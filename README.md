# First-term-project
This is my first project at the University (UNGS, Argentina). Made with Python, using Pygame Engine. The videogame consists on guessing the hiden word, like a hangman.
To test it, please open "principal.py" and run it with your ide.
This Practical Task was made to test the knowledges acquired during the term (data types, conditionals, loops, algorithms,importing images and sounds, reading/writing data from .txt's, etc).
